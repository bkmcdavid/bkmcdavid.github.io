"Don't wine-lovers love every kind of wine and find any excuse to enjoy it?"

So says Socrates in Plato's <i>Republic</i>.

What I mean to say is that my love of ancient philosophical ideas was not at all dethroned upon the rise of my love for wine.

It happened in Australia when I became the president of my college's Senior Common Room and gained access to the storied cellar. Treasures heaping, and I was like an illiterate barbarian looking in the window. So I took a couple of wine courses, visited some wine spots , and even got dirty and tired doing harvest tasks. 

I can't stop. The wine bug bit me and I think I'm in it for life.

Mornington Peninsula (Australia) 
Yarra Valley (Australia) 
Adelaide Hills (Australia) 
Clare and Eden Valleys (Australia)
