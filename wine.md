"Don't wine-lovers love every kind of wine and find any excuse to enjoy it?"

So says Socrates in Plato's <i>Republic</i>.

What I mean to say is that my love of ancient philosophical ideas seems to have been waiting for the day I would fall in love with wine.

It happened in Australia when I became the president of my college's Senior Common Room and gained access to its storied cellar. Treasures heaping, and I was like an illiterate barbarian looking in the window. So I took a couple of wine courses, visited some wine spots, and even got dirty and tired doing harvest tasks. 

I can't stop. The wine bug bit me and I think I'm in it for life. I am currently studying for my WSET Diploma under <a href="https://www.neptunewine.com/peter-neptune">Peter Neptune MS</a>.
