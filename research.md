"The Psychology of Money" is an examination of the relationship of citizens in Plato's ideal city (as described in the <i>Republic</>) to money. I argue that scholars have exaggerated Plato's aversions to money, and I suggest a reading according to which Plato appreciates the role of money in facilitating market exchange.
  
"Peer Disagreement in Aristotle's Ethical Epistemology" utilizes modern concepts in epistemology to explore the correspondence in knowledge between peer moral experts, conceived as Aristotle conceives of <i>phronesis</>.

"Aristotle on the Possibility of Artifical Intelligence" is a project in knowledge representation. I draw on Aristotle's concept of <i>nous</> as a "capable of receiving forms"</i> (<i>De Anima</i> 3.4) for approaching the question of AI's possibility and, in turn, utilize notions in modern technology for scrutinizing Aristotle.
