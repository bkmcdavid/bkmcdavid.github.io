I argue that Plato, in the <i>Republic</i> explicitly permits (and disallows interference in) self-regulation in market business among the members of the producer class.

I analyze the concept of "nature" as it is depicted and deployed in the argument of the <i>Republic</i>. My view is that nature is complex in the dialogue because it refers both to inborn capacities and to the fulfilled condition that an individual achieves at the close of their rearing. This distinction is important for differentiating Plato's meaning in asserting (1) that the philosopher's education must be reserved for those with a philosophical nature and (2) that, per the principle of specialization, each person should do the work for which they are "naturally suited." Individuals with an inborn capacity for philosophical understanding are granted admission, but only those who complete the education and see their nature fulfilled are permitted to rule.

Observing that most scholars have omitted to observe that there are two conjuncts in the account of justice on offer in the <i>Republic</i> (that justice is "doing one's work" and also "not meddling in the work of another"), I build an analysis of whether and what different work is done by these conjuncts, particularly that of the "meddling."

I defend the standard reading of the <i>Republic</i> according to which Kallipolis is the just and ideal city of Plato's political theory and the so-called "City of Pigs" is not just. My argument reconstructs and defends an account of justice from the dialogue.
