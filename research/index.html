              Since Moses Finley published his <i>The Ancient Economy</i>, scholars have rushed in to take a closer look at the economic activities of the ancients as well as the ideas about economic activity that brewed in the minds of their political theorists.  My research in this area focuses on the economic insights of Plato, with a new and yet undeveloped thread through Aristotle as well.

              My contentious view is that economic insights function as principles in Plato's political theorizing. Recovering what those economic insights <i>are</i> is and then showing their explanatory power is my main preocuppation with Plato. My research related to Aristotle centers on his conception of man as a political animal where (per the <i>Historia Animalium</i> 1.1 account of ``political animal'') it seems that coordination in a division of specialized labor seemed to be indispensable to the account. My questions for Aristotle pertain to the boundaries of what he would call ``natural'' and maybe ``properly political'' (i.e. by nature) economic activity.

                    Despite the extensiveness of top-down control in his ideal city, Plato takes seriously the idea that the market does not require total regulation via legislation and that participants in the market may be capable of self-regulation. This paper examines the discussion of market regulation in the Republic and argues that the philosopher rulers play a very limited role in regulating market activities. Indeed, they are concerned only with averting excesses of wealth and poverty. The rules and regulations that are foundational to the daily functioning of the market – enforcement of contracts, resolution of disputes, etc. – are endogenous to the market participants themselves. In allowing for this self-regulation, Plato expresses tempered optimism about the market and a profound confidence in his ideal city’s educational program.

                    Plato is often characterized as being generally disdainful of money and as believing that pursuit and possession of money is morally corrupting. I offer a modification of this view: Plato does not think that money is dangerous in general, but that it is dangerous for individuals with great natures in particular. The vast majority of people, whom Plato would classify as producers in his ideal city, are psychologically insusceptible to the dangerous influence of money. Understanding this aspect of his moral psychology encourages more careful consideration of the role of money and, much more generally, economic activities in Kallipolis. This paper (1) offers an argument regarding Plato’s moral psychology and (2) explores the function of money in his ideal constitution.

                    This paper isn't strictly about political economy, but it shows my early thinking about the principle of specialization. Some Plato scholars have recently argued that the "City of Pigs"—described in Book II of the Republic, before Socrates goes on to describe Kallipolis and the definition of justice—is better and more just than Kallipolis itself. I argue that this interpretation misconstrues Plato's conception of justice by ignoring three significant conditions that he establishes for making an entity eligible for being just. In overlooking these conditions, scholars have misconceived the definition of justice itself, resulting in an overestimation of the virtue of the City of Pigs.

              The education that Plato describes in the <i>Republic</i> is a story of nurture. My research in this area explores how Plato conceives of nurture as complementing inborn nature.

              My studies of Plato's conception of human nature begin from the premise, set out at 581c in the <i>Republic</i>, that there are "three primary kinds of people." This principle of Plato's moral psychology has implications for every dimension of the dialogue. Several of my papers explore these distinct dimensions:

                    This article examines the philosophical significance of nature (φύσις) in Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. The word is used in the protasis of the conditional clause at 515b–c where Socrates proposes to inquire into ‘what would be the manner of the release and healing from these bonds and this folly if in the course of nature (φύσει) something of this sort should happen to them’. This instance of ‘nature’ has been a matter of philological and philosophical debate, with attention paid principally to the narrow passage of the allegory for reconstructing Plato’s meaning. This article argues from the standpoint of the argument of the dialogue as a whole, showing that a particular reading of φύσις coheres with the conception of human nature in the Republic’s moral psychology. The discussion begins with consideration of the difficulties presented by the manuscript tradition, which sees variation in the recording of the clause in question. Then the attempts by scholars to resolve the problem—or else to express their inability to resolve it—are addressed and shown to be unsatisfactory. Finally, an interpretation that connects the mention of φύσις with Plato’s conception of the philosophic nature, described in Book VI of the dialogue, is offered.

                    I examine the role of nature (φύσιs) in the argument of Plato’s Republic and demonstrate that the concept plays a more central role in advancing the dialogue’s philosophical aims than has been appreciated by scholars. Socrates carefully distinguishes between the nature with which one is born and the nature that one has at the end of education. The former is one’s “original nature,” and the latter is that same original nature brought to fulfillment, a “fulfilled nature”. Both of these are referred to as φύσιs. Distinguishing them aids us in understanding the argument of the dialogue.                  </span>
