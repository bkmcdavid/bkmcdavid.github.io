My favorite classes to teach are those in which I learn.

At Chapman, I run two philosophy courses:

<a href="https://bkmcdavid.github.io/pdfs/Syllabus2022F.docx.pdf">"From Socrates to Aquinas"</a> (every semester)
<a href="https://bkmcdavid.github.io/pdfs/Phil360syllabus.pdf">"Bootcamp in Aristotle"</a> (every other Fall)


I also teach courses in the <a href="https://www.chapman.edu/research/institutes-and-centers/smith-institute-for-political-economy-and-philosophy/academics-and-research/humanomics.aspx">Humanomics program</a> offered by the <a href="https://www.chapman.edu/research/institutes-and-centers/smith-institute-for-political-economy-and-philosophy/index.aspx">Smith Institute</a> at Chapman. These are co-taught, interdisciplinary courses covering economics, literature, and philosophy. My Humanomics courses include:

It is a foray into tackling the problem of the erosion of civil discourse. Erik Kimbrough (economist) and I have developed a class that aims to equip students with skills in argument analysis and evidence evaluation. The course has been awarded Chapman's Pedagogical Innovation Grant. 


Learning should be lifelong and fun. I do it all the time and so should you.
