My favorite classes to teach are those in which I learn.

At Chapman, I'm lucky to run our ancient philosophy courses. Every semester I teach a course called "From Socrates to Aquinas" (<a href="https://bkmcdavid.github.io/pdfs/Syllabus2022F.docx.pdf">link to syllabus</a>). In Fall 2023, I will teach the first iteration of my new course "Bootcamp in Aristotle" (<a href="https://bkmcdavid.github.io/pdfs/Phil360syllabus.pdf">link to syllabus</a>).

I'm doubly lucky to teach also in the Humanomics courses offered by the Smith Institute at Chapman. These are co-taught, interdisciplinary courses covering economics, literature, and philosophy. I taught "Trust in Troubling Times" with Jan Osborn, professor in english; "Shame: The Civilizing Emotion" with Erin Crockett, professor in economics; and "What is Progress?" with Erik Kimbrough, professor in economics.

I believe in <i>showing</i> how to learn rather than telling, so I learn with my students and incorporate new-to-me readings deliberately and often.

Learning should be lifelong and fun.
