I am a philosopher specializing in ancient ethics, epistemology, and political economy. 

I work at Chapman University as an assistant professor in the philosophy department and the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy. 

Before California, I was the Seymour Reader in Ancient History and Philosophy at Ormond College in Melbourne, Australia. 

I have a PhD in philosophy from Princeton University, an MA in classical philology from the University of Arizona, and a BA from Vanderbilt University.

I also study (and love) wine.
