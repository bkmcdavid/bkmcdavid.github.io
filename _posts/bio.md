CV.pdf

I work in ancient philosophy, especially metaethics, epistemology, and political economy in Plato and Aristotle. 

In 2020, my tenure clock started ticking at Chapman University where I hold an appointment in the philosophy department and in the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy. Before that, I spent two years in a Visiting Assistant Professor position at Chapman.

Before California, I was the Seymour Reader in Ancient History and Philosophy at Ormond College in Melbourne, Australia. 

I earned my PhD at Princeton University in the Program in Classical Philosophy. Ben Morison and John Cooper oversaw my dissertation work, which concerns Aristotle's ethical epistemology.

I also have a MA from University of Arizona where I read a lot of Greek and Latin in their classical philology program. 

The philosophy bug bit me at Vanderbilt University where I studied philosophy (major), political science (major), and history (minor).

I was born in Tucson, grew up in Texas.
